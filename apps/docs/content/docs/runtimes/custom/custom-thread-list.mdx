## Overview

`useRemoteThreadListRuntime` lets you plug a custom thread database into assistant-ui. It keeps the UI and local runtime logic in sync while you provide persistence, archiving, and metadata for every conversation. The hook is exported as `unstable_useRemoteThreadListRuntime`; we refer to it here as **Custom Thread List**.

## When to Use

Use a Custom Thread List when you need to:

- Persist conversations in your own database or multitenant backend
- Share threads across devices, teams, or long-lived sessions
- Control thread metadata (titles, archived state, external identifiers)
- Layer additional adapters (history, attachments) around each thread runtime

## How It Works

Custom Thread List merges two pieces of state:

1. **Per-thread runtime** – powered by any runtime hook (for example `useLocalRuntime` or `useAssistantTransportRuntime`).
2. **Thread list adapter** – your adapter that reads and writes thread metadata in a remote store.

When the hook mounts it calls `list()` on your adapter, hydrates existing threads, and uses your runtime hook to spawn a runtime whenever a thread is opened. Creating a new conversation calls `initialize(threadId)` so you can create a record server-side and return the canonical `remoteId`.

## Build a Custom Thread List

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Provide a runtime per thread

    Use any runtime hook that returns an `AssistantRuntime`. In most custom setups this is `useLocalRuntime(modelAdapter)` or `useAssistantTransportRuntime(...)`.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Implement the adapter contract

    Your adapter decides how threads are stored. Implement the methods in the table below to connect to your database or API.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Compose the provider

    Wrap `AssistantRuntimeProvider` with the runtime returned from the Custom Thread List hook.

    ```tsx twoslash title="app/CustomThreadListProvider.tsx"
    // @filename: app/model-adapter.ts
    export const myModelAdapter = {} as any;

    // @filename: app/CustomThreadListProvider.tsx
    // ---cut---
    "use client";

    import type { ReactNode } from "react";
    import {
      AssistantRuntimeProvider,
      useLocalRuntime,
      unstable_useRemoteThreadListRuntime as useRemoteThreadListRuntime,
      type unstable_RemoteThreadListAdapter as RemoteThreadListAdapter,
    } from "@assistant-ui/react";
    import { createAssistantStream } from "assistant-stream";
    import { myModelAdapter } from "./model-adapter"; // your chat model adapter

    const threadListAdapter: RemoteThreadListAdapter = {
      async list() {
        const response = await fetch("/api/threads");
        const threads = await response.json();
        return {
          threads: threads.map((thread: any) => ({
            remoteId: thread.id,
            externalId: thread.external_id ?? undefined,
            status: thread.is_archived ? "archived" : "regular",
            title: thread.title ?? undefined,
          })),
        };
      },
      async initialize(localId) {
        const response = await fetch("/api/threads", {
          method: "POST",
          headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
          body: JSON.stringify({ localId }),
        });
        const result = await response.json();
        return { remoteId: result.id, externalId: result.external_id };
      },
      async rename(remoteId, title) {
        await fetch(`/api/threads/${remoteId}`, {
          method: "PATCH",
          headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
          body: JSON.stringify({ title }),
        });
      },
      async archive(remoteId) {
        await fetch(`/api/threads/${remoteId}/archive`, { method: "POST" });
      },
      async unarchive(remoteId) {
        await fetch(`/api/threads/${remoteId}/unarchive`, { method: "POST" });
      },
      async delete(remoteId) {
        await fetch(`/api/threads/${remoteId}`, { method: "DELETE" });
      },
      async generateTitle(remoteId, messages) {
        return createAssistantStream(async (controller) => {
          const response = await fetch(`/api/threads/${remoteId}/title`, {
            method: "POST",
            headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
            body: JSON.stringify({ messages }),
          });
          const { title } = await response.json();
          controller.appendText(title);
        });
      },
    };

    export function CustomThreadListProvider({
      children,
    }: Readonly<{ children: ReactNode }>) {
      const runtime = useRemoteThreadListRuntime({
        runtimeHook: () => useLocalRuntime(myModelAdapter),
        adapter: threadListAdapter,
      });

      return (
        <AssistantRuntimeProvider runtime={runtime}>
          {children}
        </AssistantRuntimeProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

      required: true,

      type: "ComponentType<PropsWithChildren>",
      description:
        "Optional wrapper rendered around all thread runtimes. Use it to inject adapters such as history or attachments (see the Cloud adapter).",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Thread Lifecycle Cheatsheet

- `list()` hydrates threads on mount and during refreshes.
- Creating a new conversation calls `initialize()` once the user sends the first message.
- `archive`, `unarchive`, and `delete` are called optimistically; throw to revert the UI.
- `generateTitle()` powers the automatic title button and expects an `AssistantStream`.
- Provide a `runtimeHook` that always returns a fresh runtime instance per active thread.

## Optional Adapters

If you need history or attachment support, expose them via `unstable_Provider`. The cloud implementation wraps each thread runtime with `RuntimeAdapterProvider` to inject:

- `history` – e.g. `useAssistantCloudThreadHistoryAdapter`
- `attachments` – e.g. `CloudFileAttachmentAdapter`

Reuse that pattern to register any capability your runtime requires.
